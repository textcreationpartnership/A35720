            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This premiſed, the firſt Priviledge of Parliament that I ſhall offer unto you is this, That if any of either Houſes ſhall offend or commit any Crime, that they themſelves ſhall have the cenſure and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof; yea, the ancient Cuſtom of the Houſe of Commons is, That if any ſhall chance of that Houſe to offend, or not to doe or ſay as becommeth him, or if any ſhall offend them being called to that His Highneſſe Court, that they themſelves (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ancient Cuſtome) have the puniſhment of them; which laſt priviledge of the Houſe of Commons is very large, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out unto us, That this Houſe of it ſelfe is a high Court of Juſtice, and extendeth as well to Strangers as Members of the ſame in their power of Judicature. And it appeareth that matters of Parliament are not to be ruled by the Common Law; as alſo that if they might have been elſe, where puniſhed, it ſhall be intended that ſometimes it would have been put in ure, and the Preſidents that have been againſt the Law in this point, have been in all ages condemned as illegall. And for

               </label> It is further objected, that if this ſhall be the meaning and expoſition of this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then this miſchiefe will follow, That if a Member of Parliament ſhall commit a Murder or Robbery at <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſitting at <hi>London,</hi> then it he may not be queſtioned untill the pleaſure of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be knowne he may eſcape; and ſo a heynous crime protected or permitted with impunity by this priviledge.</p>

               </label> Hence happily it may be gathered, that before this Law reſtrictive afore ſpecified in criminall matters, there was no procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings as in Civill, in Parliament againſt any Members thereof in an ordinary courſe of Juſtice, and therefore this Law was made ſomewhat to abridge this high priviledge, namely in this, that any Member offending
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63057:9"/> ſhall be ſubject to the cenſure of that great Court, in an ordinary courſe of Juſtice, which before he was not, but in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way, by Petition or the like, in which condition he now ſtands as to civill actions.</p>
            <p>To this I can give no poſitive anſwer, but I rather incline to thinke that this Law was rather parcell of the priviledge it ſelfe, or contemporary with it, and no ſubſequent Law, and ſo this collection formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned nor materiall. Alſo I conceive that if this Law before objected ſhall be found ſubſequent to the priviledge of Parliament in this particular, which for my part I doe not credit, yet before this Act or Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent Members thereof were not exempt from Juſtice but onely in a poſitive courſe of proceeding, they were ſtill ſubject to the cenſure of that high Court in an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, and ſo no Ceſſer or defect of Juſtice, which were a thing of ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Tribunell not to be imagined.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the wiſedome of the Law in the framing of theſe great priviledges in Criminall matters,<note place="margin">The Reaſon and ground of the Priviledge of the Parliament both in Criminall and Civill matters. Nota.</note> becauſe both God and man require, <hi>feſtinum remedium,</hi> the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences being exorbitant, Juſtice open and cannot be denyed even in an ordinary Courſe. Alſo the Houſe of Parliament being firſt acquainted therewith, and their leave obtained, Cenſure may be elſewhere, not otherwiſe: in civill actions not ſo, but an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ceſſation of neceſſity of ordinary courſe of Juſtice, for if otherwiſe the Parliament
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63057:10"/> would be filled with private Suits and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and many of them frivolous; the many and weighty affaires of the Kingdome in the meane time neglected. To conclude, the Parliament you ſee hath that high Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in Criminall matters communicated to no other Court of Juſtice,<note place="margin">The Priviledge of Parliament paralleld with the priviledge of inferiour Court; in Civill matters</note> but in Civill Actions there are ſome foot-ſteps of this great Priviledge in inferiour Courts; In the Common Pleas a Writ of Priviledge or <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percedeas,</hi> to ſtay proceedings againſt any member of that Court; and if the parry hath cauſe of Action, he ought to Sue in the Common Pleas: parallel this caſe with the Priviledge of Parliament in Civill Actions, you will finde it almoſt the ſame. The <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedeas,</hi> or Writ of Priviledge removeth not the Cauſe, no more is the Cauſe remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by clayming the priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a <hi>Ceſſet proceſſus legis quouſq. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Party hath cauſe of Action he muſt Sue in the Common Pleas,<note place="margin">Priviledge of Parliament in Civill Actions greater then of inferiour Courts</note> ſo may he, I take it in Parliament by Petition, or otherwiſe as the pleaſure of that Court will permit, but not in any courſe of Juſtice ordinary, as he may in the Common Pleas: here the priviledge of Parliament exceedeth the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of inferiour Courts.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in Common Pleas priviledge for Strangers, <hi>Eundo, redeundo</hi> concerning their Suits there, and this extends as well to their perſons to free them from Arreſt, as to their goods neceſſary for their Suit and Charges; priviledges of Parliament (I take) the ſame, I need not uſe repetition.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:63057:10"/>
            <p>Now to haſten to an end of this, the reaſon why the Law hath given unto this High Court, this and many other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges is for the publike good, to the end that Parliaments which are to the State <hi>Tanquam medicus aegro,</hi> like the Phiſitian to a ſicke perſon, ſhould not be eluded or fruſtrated by ſuggeſtions of Crimes againſt any members thereof by the King, or any perſons whatſoever,<note place="margin">The very being of Parliaments depend upon the priviledge in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall matters.</note> being taken away from the ſervice of the Houſes &amp; tryed elſewhere by inferiour Courts, for ſo they might take away all, and conſequently make a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what they would and when they would; which is a breach of ſo eſſentiall a priviledge, that even the very being of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments dependeth thereupon.</p>

Alſo ſee their Anſwers what they are, their Allegiance is the ground of them, as if their attendance on the Kings Perſon warranted them to doe injuſtice, to violate the Lawes of theſe Statutes before named; Is this their Allegiance to the King?

            <p>Now the people here intended in this Oath are the High Court of Parliament, for where can the people make election of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63057:20"/> wholſome Lawes for themſelves but here,<note place="margin">The Commons are there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, the Lords not ſo; but perſonally; that is the reaſon a Peere may make a Proxy, not the other.</note> where they are repreſentatively aſſembled? for no legall Aſſembly or Convention <hi>totius populi</hi> can any Hiſtory record, or antiquity of this Nation ever mention, but this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Parliament.

               </label> That a Villaine, in whom his Lord hath both in perſon and eſtate, the inheritance, the abſolute and free diſpoſition of him by Law, ſo he doth not maihem him, if in the preſence of the King he is a free man, he cannot be ſeiſed by his Lord, but it is for the time an Enfranchiſement.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sol.</note>To which I anſwer, that this Caſe is ancient, and the Law in this particular is antiquated, not abrogated; howſoever it is pertinent to out preſent purpoſe: I ſay this Caſe ſtands upon its particular reaſon, for the Kings preſence is a ſufficient Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in favour of liberty againſt the Lord, who doth not <hi>agere civiliter</hi> againſt his Villaine, that is to ſay, claime him in a courſe of Juſtice, for then if the proceed

            <p>Thus I have done with this particular, I meane the negative voice, and if there be no coerſive power to rectifie the abuſe of Authority Regall, as ſome would have it, yet it remaines ſtill a tranſgreſſion from the rule of Truth and Juſtice, and that is all that I deſire at this time to prove. If there be no limits for the impetuous waves of the proud Ocean, God hath appointed the Sands to ſtand up, and choake them. Loe here God and Nature againſt exorbitant power, but of this ſufficient.

That the proceedings of this High Court are not ſubject to any extrajudiciall cenſure or debate, wherein I will briefly-parallel this with the proceedings in inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Courts, where you ſhall finde, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63057:21"/> they are not ſo much as to be retarded or delayed by any verball command of the King, their judgements binding all, untill by legall courſe reverſed; no man, no not the King himſelfe authorized to queſtion, much leſſe nullifie their Acts in any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall way, ſo much ought the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law to be had in reverence.

            <p>It is manifeſt, that the Law is the ſquare and rule by which both King and people are directed, and regulated in inferiour Courts; What ſhall we then ſay to the high Court of Parliament, in compariſon of which, all other Courts are but <hi>Tanquam viburna cupreſſo,</hi> like ſhrubs to the lofty Cypreſſe or Cedar, from whoſe fulneſſe and abundance all other Courts receive even their power and authority.</p>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in ſome particular caſes, the chiefe Juſtice or Judge hath formerly had the ſole power as concerning Writs of Errour, viz. that the warrant for the iſſuing out the Writ of Errour to the Chancery ought to be under the Teſte of the chiefe Juſtice of the Kings Bench,<note place="margin">No judiciall but miniſteriall acts by law tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted ſolely, by any one Judge in inferiour Courts. <hi>vid.

For it appeares they come to oppoſe the Law, a great offence, by theſe Lawes evident enough.

The Allegiance of the Subject may be declined, and yet the Kings perſon followed in the Warres; for the Regall Warres may be unjuſt upon all theſe Statutes, and ſo it is cleare to any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man.

            <p>The King doth erre in his Judgement, his Commands are contrary to Law; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Kings Command to apprehend the Members of the Houſe of Commons, contrary to their Lawes and Priviledges, and to try them upon ſuppoſed Crimes elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;

The illegall Commiſſion of Array ſo often iſſuing forth, a great oppreſſion to the people, whereby he armeth thouſands of men, at this day, contrary to Law and Juſtice, the King claiming no other power to Array his people, or Arme them by his owne Declarations in print, but which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Statute of 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. before remembred, and that Statute is not in force, as you may perceive in this Treatiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.

            <p>In his Majeſties abſence from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment theſe Agents have not been idle, they then labour to invalide all the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Parliament without the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence perſonally, they Arraigne them, and Judge them as <hi>null,</hi> and void by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall Declarations, there is a ſuddaine
